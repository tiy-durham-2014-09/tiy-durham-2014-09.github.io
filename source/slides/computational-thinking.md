# Computational Thinking

---

> Computational thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can effectively be carried out by an information-processing agent.

-- Jan Cuny, Larry Snyder, and Jeannette M. Wing

# Computational thinking means being able to:

---

* Understand which parts of a problem can be computed,
* Evaluate the match between computational tools and techniques and a problem,
* Understand the limitations and power of tools and techniques,
* Apply a tool or technique to a new use,
* Recognize an opportunity to use computation in a new way, and
* Apply computational strategies in any domain.

---

# Key areas

* compositional reasoning
* pattern matching
* procedural thinking

# Compositional reasoning

Real-world problems are large.

We need to _decompose_ them into smaller problems.

# Pattern matching

When we don't know how to do something, look for commonalities and differences.

```javascript
void draw() {
    background(255);
    stroke(0,0,0);
    line(0,0,60,hour());
    line(0,0,120,minute());
    stroke(255,0,0);
    line(0,0,180,second());
}
```

# Procedural thinking

Many problems can be solved with _algorithms_.

A good algorithm can be _abstracted_.

You have eight seemingly identical steel balls and a two arm balance scale.  One of the balls is slightly heavier than the others, but you canâ€™t tell which one by just looking at all the balls.  Using the scale, what is the least number of times you will need to do a weighing to find out which ball is the heavy one?
